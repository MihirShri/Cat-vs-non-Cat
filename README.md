# Cat-vs-non-Cat
This repository contains the code along with the necessary data for a classical image classification problem - Cat vs Non Cat. You need to feed an image to the code and it will output whether the input image is that of a cat or not.<br/><br/> This has been implemented using deep learning techniques without using any deep learning libraries.
